# Notesque App

One of my portfolio sample, built for my capstone project in React Development Course by Dicoding Indonesia.

Built with React JS Library, nothing sophisticated other than using states and props to store your quick notes,
Further development is <u>always</u> able to carry on, it depends on our own creativity
